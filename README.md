# TSP

CS211 project that required me to use a TSP algorithm to create and app that minimized the delay in delivering pizzas.
I used the 'nearest neighbour' algorithm, which found the distance from the current house to all other houses that had pending orders, and then travelled to the nearest house.
This allowed the delivery driver to travel from house to house quickly to reduce the total delay time.
